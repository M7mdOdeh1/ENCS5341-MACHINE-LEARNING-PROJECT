# Student Performance Prediction Project

## Overview
This project uses machine learning models to predict student performance (pass/fail) based on various attributes. The dataset includes 395 students and 33 features from Kaggle.

## Models
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Logistic Regression**

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Selection
- Hyperparameter Tuning

## Evaluation
Models are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices. The Random Forest Classifier showed the best performance.

## Conclusions
The study provides insights into the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting student outcomes, with the Random Forest model being particularly noteworthy for its accuracy and robustness.
