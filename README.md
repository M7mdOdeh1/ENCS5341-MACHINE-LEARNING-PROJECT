# Student Performance Prediction Project

## Overview
This project employs machine learning to predict student performance (pass/fail). Using a dataset from Kaggle, it analyzes data on 395 students across 33 features to understand the factors influencing academic success.

## Models
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** A simple, intuitive model that classifies students based on similarity to nearest data points.
- **Random Forest Classifier:** A powerful ensemble model that uses multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and prevent overfitting.
- **Logistic Regression:** A fundamental model for binary classification, offering straightforward interpretation of results.

## Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In-depth analysis of data characteristics, distributions, and relationships between features.
- **Feature Selection:** Identification of the most relevant features impacting student performance using Random Forest importance ranking.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimization of model parameters to enhance prediction accuracy and model performance.

## Evaluation
Comprehensive evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices. Detailed comparison of model performances, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

## Conclusions
Insights into the applicability of machine learning in educational settings, with the Random Forest model demonstrating exceptional capability in predicting student outcomes.
